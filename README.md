Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Git and Github, as well as continuing to develop my coding skills.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project to build and code from scratch my own high power rocketry altimeter.
- âš¡ My favorite hobbies are rocketry, coding, and CAD modeling.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on AerE 361's final project coming up with a unique system.
